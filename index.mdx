description: "Technical deep dives into ticket-oriented debugging, distributed systems, and the philosophy of Compound Engineering. These guides document system behavior, architectural decisions, and real-world debugging lessons. Whether you use OpenBug or not, we hope you learn something about how modern distributed systems break—and how to fix them."

# Welcome to OpenBug

OpenBug is a **ticket-oriented debugging workspace** built to solve the "cold start" problem[cite: 130, 319]. Instead of generic code chat, OpenBug creates a dedicated harness to reproduce bugs, correlate evidence across multiple services, and generate a verified root-cause analysis[cite: 35, 137].



## The Core Workflow
OpenBug is designed for the reproduce → root-cause → fix loop[cite: 513, 516].

* **Ticket-Oriented Design**: The entry point is a bug assigned to you from JIRA, Linear, or GitHub[cite: 426, 468].
* **Multi-Service Correlation**: OpenBug runs your services, captures runtime evidence, and correlates what happened across them—so one ticket doesn't mean five terminal tabs[cite: 125, 203].
* **Compound Engineering**: Every investigation updates a `runbook` file in your repository, building collective team knowledge over time[cite: 528, 921].

## Workspace Components
The OpenBug Studio is organized into three main functional areas to help you focus on one task at a time[cite: 117, 233]:

1.  **Investigation Pane**: The central area where the agent output lives and the mission-based chat occurs[cite: 179, 192].
2.  **Resources Panel**: A view of all connected services, Git repositories, and system architecture to provide grounding evidence[cite: 181, 203].
3.  **Runbook**: A historical journal of learnings, including reproduction steps and environment insights[cite: 500, 509].

## Why OpenBug?
* **Solves the Cold Start**: Unlike build-time agents (Cursor or Claude Code) that have immediate context, OpenBug is built for backlog bugs where you need to get acquainted with the issue from scratch[cite: 141, 323].
* **Evidence-Based**: Every suggestion is backed by "evidence pins" from your actual logs and code directory[cite: 183, 193].
* **Local-First**: Keep your code and logs on your machine while utilizing top-tier AI agents for reasoning[cite: 1004].

## Community & Open Source
* **GitHub**: Star the project or contribute to the open-source debugging stack.
* **Local-First**: Designed to run where you debug—on your laptop.
