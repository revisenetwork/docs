title: "Engineering Notes"
description: "Technical deep dives into debugging, distributed systems, and the architecture behind OnCall.  These are engineering notes documenting system behavior, architectural decisions, and real-world debugging lessons. Whether you use OnCall or not, we hope you learn something about how modern distributed systems break (and how to fix them)."

## The Philosophy

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Why Logs > Prompts" icon="file-lines">
    **The Manifesto.** Copilots hallucinate because they lack context. OnCall bets on runtime signals over chat windows. Read why we process logs locally instead of relying on long prompts.
