# The Future of AI Debugging

Debugging is evolving. We are moving away from manual stack trace analysis toward autonomous agents that can diagnose and patch code in real-time.

<Note>
  This post assumes you have the **Termite CLI** installed. If not, check out our [installation guide](/get-started).

## Intelligent Error parsing

Traditional debuggers give you the *where*. AI debuggers give you the *why*.

## Comparison: Old vs New

Here is how the workflow changes when you adopt an AI-first approach.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Old Way
  # 1. Run code
  # 2. See error
  # 3. Copy error to Google/StackOverflow
  # 4. Try random fix
  npm run dev
</CodeGroup>
  
What's Next?
We are currently rolling out beta access to our VS Code extension.
