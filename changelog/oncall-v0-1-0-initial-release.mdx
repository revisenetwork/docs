# OnCall v0.1.0

OnCall v0.1.0 marks the **initial public release** of the OnCall debugging CLI.

This version establishes the foundation for interactive, AI-assisted debugging workflows.

## What’s Included in v0.1.0

### Interactive Debugging for a Single Process

Attach OnCall to a running command and debug it interactively as it executes.

### Real-Time Log Inspection

Inspect logs live during execution instead of relying on post-mortem analysis.

### AI Assistance During Failures

Use AI to:

- Explain errors
- Identify failure causes
- Suggest next investigation steps

Originally released under the internal working title `clippy-test`, this version laid the groundwork for all future system-level debugging capabilities.
