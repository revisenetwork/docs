# Overview

Learn about OnCall CLI, an AI‑powered debugging tool that runs in your terminal and helps you understand, triage, and fix issues across your services in real time.

### Get started in 30 seconds

**Prerequisites**

* Node.js 18+ installed  
* An OnCall account and API key from the dashboard ([app.oncall.build](https://app.oncall.build))

#### Install OnCall CLI

```bash
npm install -g oncall-cli
```

#### Start using OnCall CLI

```bash
cd your-project

# One‑time setup per project
oncall init -m "Describe this service" -id "<project-id>"

# One‑time setup per machine
oncall login <your-api-key>

# Start OnCall Cluster
oncall cluster

# Start your app under OnCall’s debugger
oncall npm run dev
```

On first use, `oncall login` stores your API key in `~/.oncall/config`. After that, you can prefix any command with `oncall` to launch the interactive logs + AI chat interface.

### What it does for you

* **Real‑time debugging:** run any command through OnCall CLI, stream logs live, and ask the AI to explain failures or propose fixes while the process runs.
* **Multi‑service log Q&A:** query logs across multiple services that share the same project ID (frontend, backend, workers, microservices).
* **Contextual code inspection:** let the AI read targeted slices of code (when `code_available: true`) to explain or fix issues it detects in logs.
* **Cross‑service correlation:** with the local cluster server, AI can reason across all registered services in a project, pick which service to inspect, and trace issues end to end.
* **Tooling you control:** AI uses local tools (`read_file`, `grep_search`, `tail_logs`, `grep_logs`, `get_recent_errors`, `read_logs`) and respects `logs_available` / `code_available` flags.

### Why devs love OnCall CLI

* Works in the terminal you already use (Ink‑based UI with split panes for logs and AI chat; keyboard shortcuts for focus, view toggles, clearing panes).
* Live log awareness: logs are captured character‑by‑character via `node-pty`, so AI always has the freshest context without reloading.
* Flexible access control: per‑service `oncall.yaml` flags gate code and log access; safe for production (log‑only) or full‑access development.
* Multi‑service ready: cluster mode groups services by project ID, enabling unified debugging across devices or pods with minimal setup.
* Concrete, actionable help: AI doesn’t just diagnose; it reads code (when allowed), searches it, inspects logs, and returns specific fixes or steps.
