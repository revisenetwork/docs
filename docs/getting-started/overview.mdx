# Overview

### Get started in 30 seconds

**Prerequisites**

- Node.js 20+ installed
- An OpenBug account and API key from the dashboard ([`app.oncall.build`](https://app.oncall.build/))

#### Install OpenBug CLI

```bash
npm install -g @openbug/cli
```

#### Start using OpenBug CLI

```bash
cd your-project

# One-time setup per machine
debug login <your-api-key>

# Start OpenBug Cli
debug

# Start your app under OpenBug's debugger
debug npm run dev
```

On first use, `debug login` stores your API key in `~/.openbug/config`. After that, you can prefix any command with `debug` to launch the interactive logs. For AI chat interface run `debug`.

### What it does for you

- **Real-time debugging:** run any command through OpenBug CLI, stream logs live, and ask the AI to explain failures or propose fixes while the process runs.
- **Multi-service log Q&A:** query logs across multiple services that share the same project ID (frontend, backend, workers, microservices).
- **Contextual code inspection:** let the AI read targeted slices of code (when code_available: true) to explain or fix issues it detects in logs.
- **Cross-service correlation:** with the local cluster server, AI can reason across all registered services in a project, pick which service to inspect, and trace issues end to end.
- **Tooling you control:** AI uses local tools (read_file, grep_search, tail_logs, grep_logs, get_recent_errors, read_logs) and respects logs_available / code_available flags.

### Why devs love OpenBug CLI 

- Works in the terminal you already use (Ink-based UI with split panes for logs and AI chat; keyboard shortcuts for focus, view toggles, clearing panes).
- **Live log awareness:** logs are captured character-by-character via node-pty, so AI always has the freshest context without reloading.
- **Flexible access control:** per-service openbug.yaml flags gate code and log access; safe for production (log-only) or full-access development.
- **Multi-service ready:** cluster mode groups services by project ID, enabling unified debugging across devices or pods with minimal setup.
-  **Concrete, actionable help:** AI doesn’t just diagnose; it reads code (when allowed), searches it, inspects logs, and returns specific fixes or steps.
