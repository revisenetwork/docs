#### Usage analytics

From the dashboard’s token view you can:

* **Measure adoption:** increasing token usage over time usually indicates more developers or services are relying on OnCall for debugging.
* **Identify heavy users or teams (when keys are scoped):** if you assign different keys to different teams or environments, comparing their usage curves helps you see who is getting the most value.
* **Monitor incident‑driven usage:** spikes can correlate with production incidents or major deploys; this helps you understand when OnCall is most critical to your workflow.

#### Improving how you use OnCall

You can use dashboard analytics to tune how you run OnCall:

* If most tokens are spent in production keys, consider:
  * Tightening `code_available` / `logs_available` where appropriate.
  * Moving some exploratory debugging to staging or dev.
* If usage is low for a team that should be using OnCall heavily:
  * Re‑share quickstart and common workflow docs.
  * Confirm that `oncall.yaml` and `API_KEY` are correctly configured in that environment.

Together, Monitoring and Analytics give you a simple way to see how OnCall is being used across keys and environments, without exposing sensitive application data in the dashboard itself.
