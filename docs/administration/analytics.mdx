#### Usage analytics

From the dashboard’s token view you can:

* **Measure adoption**:
  * Increasing token usage over time usually indicates more developers or services are relying on OpenBug for debugging.
* **Identify heavy users or teams** (when keys are scoped):
  * If you assign different keys to different teams or environments, comparing their usage curves helps you see who is getting the most value.
* **Monitor incident-driven usage**:
  * Spikes can correlate with production incidents or major deploys; this helps you understand when OpenBug is most critical to your workflow.

#### Improving how you use OpenBug

You can use dashboard analytics to tune how you run OpenBug:

* If most tokens are spent in **production keys**, consider:
  * Tightening `code_available` / `logs_available` where appropriate.
  * Moving some exploratory debugging to staging or dev.
* If usage is low for a team that should be using OpenBug heavily:
  * Re-share quickstart and common workflow docs.
  * Confirm that `openbug.yaml` and `API_KEY` are correctly configured in that environment.

Together, Monitoring and Analytics give you a simple way to see how OpenBug is being used across keys and environments, without exposing sensitive application data in the dashboard itself.
