### System Requirements

#### Operating environment

* **Node.js:** OnCall CLI requires Node.js 18+.
  * Install from your OS package manager or from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).
  * Use `node -v` to verify you are on 18.x or later.
* **Package manager:** `npm` (or another Node‑compatible package manager) to install `oncall-cli`.
* **Shell:** Any shell that can run Node‑based CLIs and your app commands (for example, Bash, Zsh, or a POSIX‑like shell).
  * On Windows, running inside WSL or a Unix‑like shell is recommended.

#### Network connectivity

* **OnCall API and WebSocket**  
  * HTTPS access to the API base URL configured in the CLI (default: `https://api.oncall.build/v2/api`).
  * WebSocket access to the debugging endpoint (default: `wss://api.oncall.build/v2/ws`).
  * These are required for authentication, AI processing, and streaming responses to your terminal.
* **Local cluster server**  
  * When using `oncall cluster`, port 4466 must be available on the machine running the cluster server (or whatever port you configure).
  * All services that participate in the same project `id` must be able to reach the cluster server URL (default: `ws://127.0.0.1:4466`).

#### File system and project layout

* Each service you want to debug should have:
  * An accessible project directory (your app’s source and dependencies).
  * An `oncall.yaml` file in that directory describing:
    * `id` (project ID used for clustering),
    * `description`, `name`,
    * `window_id`,
    * `logs_available`, `code_available`.
* The user running OnCall CLI must have read access to:
  * The project’s code files (for `read_file` / `grep_search` if `code_available: true`).
  * Any logs produced by the command being wrapped (for log tools when `logs_available: true`).

#### OnCall service and dashboard

* OnCall’s managed debugging service and dashboard are hosted for you; you do not need to run this service locally.
* You do need:
  * A valid API key from the OnCall dashboard (stored via `oncall login <api-key>`).
  * Browser access to the dashboard to view usage (tokens, current usage bar, and usage‑by‑date chart) associated with your key.

If your environment meets these requirements, you can install `oncall-cli`, log in with your API key, and start debugging using the flows described in the quickstart and common workflows docs.
