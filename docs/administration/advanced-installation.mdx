# Advanced installation

### System Requirements

#### Operating environment

* **Node.js**: OpenBug CLI requires **Node.js 20+**.
  * Install from your OS package manager or from `nodejs.org`.
  * Use `node -v` to verify you are on 18.x or later.
* **Package manager**: `npm` (or another Node-compatible package manager) to install `@openbug/cli`.
* **Shell**: Any shell that can run Node-based CLIs and your app commands (for example, Bash, Zsh, or a POSIX-like shell).
  * On Windows, running inside WSL or a Unix-like shell is recommended.

#### Network connectivity

* **OpenBug API and WebSocket**
  * HTTPS access to the API base URL configured in the CLI (default: `https://api.oncall.build/v2/api`).
  * WebSocket access to the debugging endpoint (default: `wss://api.oncall.build/v2/ws`).
  * These are required for authentication, AI processing, and streaming responses to your terminal.
* **Local cluster server**
  * When using `debug`, port **4466** must be available on the machine running the cluster server (or whatever port you configure).
  * All services that participate in the same project `id` must be able to reach the cluster server URL (default: `ws://127.0.0.1:4466`).

#### File system and project layout

* Each service you want to debug should have:
  * An accessible project directory (your app’s source and dependencies).
  * An `openbug.yaml` file in that directory describing:
    * `id` (project ID used for clustering),
    * `description`, `name`,
    * `window_id`,
    * `logs_available`, `code_available`.
* The user running OpenBug CLI must have read access to:
  * The project’s code files (for `read_file` / `grep_search` if `code_available: true`).
  * Any logs produced by the command being wrapped (for log tools when `logs_available: true`).

#### OpenBug service and dashboard

* OpenBug's managed debugging service and dashboard are hosted for you; you do **not** need to run this service locally.
* You do need:
  * A valid API key from the OpenBug dashboard (stored in `~/.openbug/config` via `debug login <api-key>`).
  * Browser access to the dashboard to view usage (tokens, current usage bar, and usage-by-date chart) associated with your key.

If your environment meets these requirements, you can install `@openbug/cli`, log in with your API key, and start debugging using the flows described in the quickstart and common workflows docs.
