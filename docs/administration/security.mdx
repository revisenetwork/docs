#### API key handling

* **Storage**:
  * API keys are stored in `~/.openbug/config` in a simple key-value format.
  * Only the user account running OpenBug CLI should have read/write access to this file.
* **Usage**:
  * The CLI reads the key at startup and uses it only to authenticate to the OpenBug debugging service over HTTPS/WebSocket (defaults: `https://api.oncall.build/v2/api`, `wss://api.oncall.build/v2/ws`).
  * Keys are not shared with other processes by the CLI.
* **Revocation**:
  * If a key is compromised or no longer needed, delete it from the dashboard (`https://app.oncall.build/`) and run `debug login <new-api-key>` with a replacement key.

#### Code and log access boundaries

* **Local execution of tools**:
  * All file and log tools (`read_file`, `grep_search`, `read_logs`, `tail_logs`, `grep_logs`, `get_recent_errors`) execute locally on the machine running OpenBug CLI.
  * The OpenBug debugging service never directly reads your filesystem; it only receives the **results** of tool calls that the CLI decides are allowed.
* **Opt-in exposure via flags**:
  * `logs_available` and `code_available` in `openbug.yaml` explicitly control whether logs or code can be accessed by the AI for a given service.
  * When these flags are `false`, the CLI blocks the corresponding tools and sends a denial message instead of any data.
* **Environment separation**:
  * You can use stricter settings in sensitive environments (for example, `code_available: false` in production) while keeping full access in development.

#### Network paths

* **OpenBug service communication**:
  * All communication with the managed OpenBug debugging service uses HTTPS (`API_BASE_URL`) and WebSocket over TLS (`WEB_SOCKET_URL`), as configured in the CLI.
  * Only authenticated sessions (valid API key) can access the debugging graph.
* **Cluster server**:
  * The local cluster server (`debug`) runs on a host/port you control (default `127.0.0.1:4466`).
  * It only shares service metadata and access flags (not full code or logs) with the backend via the CLI’s architecture description.

#### Principle of least privilege

* **Per-service configuration**:
  * Each service independently controls whether its logs and code are available to the AI.
  * This lets you keep noisy or sensitive services out of scope while still debugging others.
* **Scoped data sharing**:
  * Logs and code are only sent to the OpenBug debugging service when the AI explicitly requests a tool and the CLI allows it under the current flags.
  * If you only ever run OpenBug with `logs_available: false` and `code_available: false`, the service only sees your questions and any text you paste into chat.

Review your `openbug.yaml` and `~/.openbug/config` regularly to ensure they match your organization’s security expectations, especially across development, staging, and production environments.
