# Security

This section describes the main security properties of OnCall CLI based on how the CLI, the OnCall debugging service, and the cluster server interact.

#### API key handling

* **Storage:**
  * API keys are stored in `~/.oncall/config` in a simple key‑value format.
  * Only the user account running OnCall CLI should have read/write access to this file.
* **Usage:**
  * The CLI reads the key at startup and uses it only to authenticate to the OnCall debugging service over HTTPS/WebSocket (defaults: `https://api.oncall.build/v2/api`, `wss://api.oncall.build/v2/ws`).
  * Keys are not shared with other processes by the CLI.
* **Revocation:**
  * If a key is compromised or no longer needed, delete it from the dashboard (`https://app.oncall.build/`) and run `oncall login <new-api-key>` with a replacement key.

#### Code and log access boundaries

* **Local execution of tools:**
  * All file and log tools (`read_file`, `grep_search`, `read_logs`, `tail_logs`, `grep_logs`, `get_recent_errors`) execute locally on the machine running OnCall CLI.
  * The OnCall debugging service never directly reads your filesystem; it only receives the results of tool calls that the CLI decides are allowed.
* **Opt‑in exposure via flags:**
  * `logs_available` and `code_available` in `oncall.yaml` explicitly control whether logs or code can be accessed by the AI for a given service.
  * When these flags are `false`, the CLI blocks the corresponding tools and sends a denial message instead of any data.
* **Environment separation:**
  * You can use stricter settings in sensitive environments (for example, `code_available: false` in production) while keeping full access in development.

#### Network paths

* **OnCall service communication:**
  * All communication with the managed OnCall debugging service uses HTTPS (`API_BASE_URL`) and WebSocket over TLS (`WEB_SOCKET_URL`), as configured in the CLI.
  * Only authenticated sessions (valid API key) can access the debugging graph.
* **Cluster server:**
  * The local cluster server (`oncall cluster`) runs on a host/port you control (default `127.0.0.1:4466`).
  * It only shares service metadata and access flags (not full code or logs) with the backend via the CLI’s architecture description.

#### Principle of least privilege

* **Per‑service configuration:**
  * Each service independently controls whether its logs and code are available to the AI.
  * This lets you keep noisy or sensitive services out of scope while still debugging others.
* **Scoped data sharing:**
  * Logs and code are only sent to the OnCall debugging service when the AI explicitly requests a tool and the CLI allows it under the current flags.
  * If you only ever run OnCall with `logs_available: false` and `code_available: false`, the service only sees your questions and any text you explicitly paste into chat.

*Review your `oncall.yaml` and `~/.oncall/config` regularly to ensure they match your organization’s security expectations, especially across development, staging, and production environments.*
