## Intelligent Error parsing

Traditional debuggers give you the _where_. AI debuggers give you the _why_.

## Comparison: Old vs New

Here is how the workflow changes when you adopt an AI-first approach.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Old Way
# 1. Run code
# 2. See error
# 3. Copy error to Google/StackOverflow
# 4. Try random fix
npm run dev
```


```bash New Way (OnCall)
# 1. Run code
# 2. OnCall intercepts error
# 3. OnCall suggests fix
# 4. You press 'y' to apply
oncall run dev
```

## What's Next?

We are currently rolling out beta access to our VS Code extension.
