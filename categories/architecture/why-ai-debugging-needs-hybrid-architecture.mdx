# Why AI Debugging Needs a Hybrid Architecture: Local Context, Cloud Reasoning

Created: December 4, 2025 2:16 PM
Article Summary (TLDR): Debugging requires a hybrid architecture that combines local introspection (logs, code, diffs, environment) with cloud intelligence (LLM reasoning, workflow graphs) and token-efficient context packaging, positioning the system as an evolution in AI debugging methods.
