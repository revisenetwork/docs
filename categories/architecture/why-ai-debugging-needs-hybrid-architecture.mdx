**Theme:** Foundation for the entire series.

**Summary:**

Explain why debugging requires:

- Local introspection (logs, code, diffs, env)
- Cloud intelligence (LLM reasoning, workflow graphs)
- Token-efficient context packaging

Position your system as the evolution of how AI should debug.

**Keywords:**
