<Note>
  **The shift from Chatbots to Agents.**
  It’s easy to make an LLM write code. It’s hard to trust an LLM to deploy a fix to production. This category explores the engineering required to cross that gap—moving from stochastic text generation to deterministic system actions.

## The Challenge

Copilots are excellent assistants because a human is always in the loop to verify the output. But autonomous debugging agents don't have that luxury. They need to reason about complex distributed systems without hallucinating.

In this section, we document our research and engineering efforts into making LLMs reliable enough for on-call scenarios. We focus on context engineering over prompt engineering—giving the model the right runtime signals so it doesn't have to guess.

## Future Topics & Research Areas

We are actively writing notes on the following subjects.

    How to flatten complex trace data and log clumps into formats that maximize LLM comprehension without blowing up token budgets.

  <Card title="Constraining Outputs" icon="brackets-curly">
    Moving beyond natural language. Techniques for forcing models to output strictly validated JSON schema or executable tool calls.

  <Card title="Hallucination Guardrails" icon="shield-xmark">
    Implementing verification steps where the agent must prove its proposed root cause against actual runtime data before suggesting a fix.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Eval Frameworks for SRE Agents" icon="chart-network">
    How do you measure the success of a debugging agent? It's not BLEU scores. We're defining metrics based on Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR) reduction and accuracy of root cause identification.
