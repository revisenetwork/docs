## Multi-Service AI Debugging Across Frontend and Backend

v0.4.0 introduces **project-level, multi-service debugging** in OnCall.  
You can now investigate issues that span across frontend, backend, workers, and more — **in a single session**.

---

### 🚀 What’s New

- 🧩 **`oncall cluster`**  
  Debug across multiple services by registering them to a shared local cluster.

- 🏗️ **`oncall init`**  
  Group related processes under a single project ID for cleaner system-level investigations.

- 🔁 **Multi-process debugging**  
  Attach and inspect multiple running processes together.

- 🌐 **Cross-service context expansion**  
  AI investigations now reason over logs and runtime signals from all connected services.

- 🧹 **CLI standardization**  
  Renamed npm package to `oncall-cli` and standardized the command as `oncall`.

---

### 🧠 Why This Matters

Most production issues are **distributed bugs**, not single-process failures.

This release shifts OnCall from *process-level debugging* to **system-level investigation**, making it practical for real-world architectures.
