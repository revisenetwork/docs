## Multi-Service AI Debugging Across Frontend and Backend

v0.4.0 is a major step forward for OnCall. This release introduces **project-level, multi-service debugging**, allowing developers to investigate issues that span frontend, backend, workers, and other processes in a single session.

### What’s New

**oncall cluster**  
Debug across multiple services by registering them to a shared local cluster. This enables correlated investigations across services without switching tools or terminals.

**oncall init**  
Group related processes under a single project ID, making it easier to reason about complex systems and share a consistent debugging setup across a team.

**Multi-process debugging in one session**  
Attach multiple running processes and debug them together instead of treating each service in isolation.

**Cross-service context expansion**  
AI investigations now reason over logs and runtime signals from all connected services, not just the process that triggered the investigation.

**CLI standardization**  
The npm package has been renamed from `clippy-test` to `oncall-cli`, and the standard CLI command is now `oncall`.

### Why This Matters

Most production bugs are distributed across services.  
This release shifts OnCall from process-level debugging to **system-level investigation**, making it practical for real-world architectures.

## Unlimited Log Search and Deeper AI Investigations

v0.3.1 focuses on removing constraints during debugging and making AI investigations more flexible and cost-efficient.

### What’s New

**Full log search across all available logs**  
Search without artificial limits on context size, enabling broader exploration before narrowing down a root cause.

**Expanded investigation scope**  
Investigations now go beyond breaking failures and support performance issues, anomalies, and unclear runtime behavior.

**More flexible queries**  
Ask natural questions across logs, code, and runtime signals without rigid formats.

**Reduced token usage**  
Internal optimizations significantly reduce token consumption during investigations.

### Why This Matters

Debugging often requires wide exploration before precision.  
This release removes friction during that exploration phase while keeping investigations efficient.

## Adaptive, Tool-Driven AI Debugging

v0.3.0 upgrades the core investigation engine powering OnCall. AI investigations are no longer fixed scripts and are now adaptive and evidence-driven.

### What’s New

**Local code and log navigation**  
During investigations, the AI can navigate local files and logs to ground its reasoning in real runtime evidence.

**Remote investigations with local context**  
Investigations run remotely while securely accessing local logs and code when needed.

**Adaptive investigation flows**  
Investigation paths can branch, loop, and adjust direction based on new evidence, instead of following fixed step sequences.

### Why This Matters

Real debugging is non-linear.  
This release makes AI behave less like a checklist and more like a thoughtful debugging partner.

## Live AI Debugging for Running Processes

v0.2.0 introduces interactive AI-assisted debugging for running processes, allowing issues to be investigated as they happen.

### What’s New

**AI-assisted debugging for live processes**  
Attach OnCall to a running command and investigate runtime behavior in real time.

**Split terminal interface**  
A split view shows live logs alongside AI interaction, removing the need for context switching.

**Optional AI reasoning visibility**  
Developers can inspect how the AI is reasoning during investigations when deeper understanding is needed.

### Why This Matters

This release turns debugging into a live conversation with your system instead of a post-mortem exercise.

## Interactive AI Debugging for a Single Process

v0.1.0 is the first public release of OnCall, focused on interactive debugging for a single running process.

### What’s Included

**Interactive AI-assisted debugging**  
Debug a running command with AI assistance during execution.

**Real-time log inspection**  
Inspect logs as they are produced instead of after failure.

**CLI-first workflow**  
Designed from day one to fit naturally into existing terminal-based developer workflows.

This version was released under the internal working title `clippy-test`.

### Why This Matters

Every system-level debugging tool starts small.  
This release laid the foundation for everything that followed.
